## Background

The [Text Fragments specification](https://wicg.github.io/ScrollToTextFragment/)
adds support for specifying a text snippet in the URL fragment.

```
#:~:text=[prefix-,]textStart[,textEnd][,-suffix]
```

When navigating to a URL with such a fragment, the user agent can quickly
emphasize and/or bring it to the user's attention.

Try it out by clicking on this link:
